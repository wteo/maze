# Maze

Based on section 25, the Udemy Course "The Modern Javascript Bootcamp Course (2022"), I built a maze game using with the use of MatterJS library.

To win, take control of the red ball and nagivate through a maze and reach your end target.

Use the keyboard buttons below to move the red ball.

"W" --> "Up"
"D" --> "Right"
"S" --> "Down"
"A" --> "Left"

Each time you refresh the page, the app will generate a brand new maze.
