# Maze

Based on section 25, the Udemy Course "The Modern Javascript Bootcamp Course (2022"), I built a maze game with the help of MatterJS library.

In this game, you take control of the red ball.

To win, navigate through the maze and reach your end goal.
Your end goal is this green square.

Use these key controls below to move your ball.

To play the game again, simply refresh the web page. Each time you do this, a brand new maze is generated.
